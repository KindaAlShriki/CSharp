# CSharp

Welcome! This repository contains a collection of my C# projects completed during my learning journey with C# and the .NET framework.

## 💡 About

These projects were built as part of my hands-on experience with:
- C# fundamentals and syntax
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Interface implementation and operator overloading
- ASP.NET MVC web application development
- Entity Framework and SQL Server integration

Each project was created to reinforce key programming concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

## 📁 Project Highlights

- **Employee Comparison App**  
  Demonstrates operator overloading and object comparison using custom logic.

- **IQuittable Interface Example**  
  Uses interfaces and polymorphism to showcase dynamic behavior in classes.

- **ASP.NET MVC Car Insurance Quote App**  
  A full-stack web app that captures user input, validates models, calculates quotes, and persists data in a SQL database.


## 🛠 Technologies Used

- C#
- .NET Framework / .NET Core
- ASP.NET MVC
- Entity Framework
- SQL Server

## 📌 Purpose

This repo serves both as a portfolio of my learning progress and a reference for best practices as I continue to grow as a C# developer.
